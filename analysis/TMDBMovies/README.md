## TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

### Description:
What can we say about the success of a movie before it is released? Are there certain companies (Pixar?) that have found a consistent formula? Given that major films costing over $100 million to produce can still flop, this question is more important than ever to the industry. Can we predict which films will be highly rated, whether or not they are a commercial success? The goal here is to come up with insights by analyzing the dataset.
