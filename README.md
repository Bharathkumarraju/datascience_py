#### This repository is intended for data-science beginners. 
#### It contains solutions (in python) to some of the machine learning projects available on Kaggle and AnalyticsVidhya, right from scrubbing the data to modelling the data.

The following algorithms have been put to use in these problems:

#### Regression:
1. Linear Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest (Bagging algorithm)

#### Classification:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbours
3. Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest (Bagging algorithm)

#### Boosting:
1. LightGBM
2. CatBoost
3. XGBoost

You can find examples of Stacking and GridSearch as well.
